# Fritzing

## Download

You can download it [here](https://fritzing.org/download/) but it is OpenSource project
so you can also build it from source or using package manager:

```bash
yay -S fritzing
```

## Parts / Libs

You might want to add some more modules to your project, here are some common libs:

* [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library)
* [Sparkfun](https://github.com/sparkfun/Fritzing_Parts)

## Custom parts

Some tutorials are outdated, because it changed how you create custom parts some time ago.
To do it now, you need to start with existing part (Core->IC, it has option to choose number of pins)
And then you need to create new SVG. Whole App works based on SVG so you need to work with that.
